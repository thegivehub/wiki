## Blockchain Integration

The Give Hub leverages the Stellar blockchain for transparent and efficient fund management. Our Soroban smart contracts handle:

- Automated milestone-based fund releases
- Multi-signature verification for large transactions
- Impact metric verification and storage
- Cross-border payment processing

```javascript
// Example: Process milestone verification and fund release
const milestoneVerification = await app.client.campaigns.verifyMilestone({
    campaignId: 'campaign_123',
    milestoneId: 'milestone_456',
    verification: {
        status: 'completed',
        evidence: [{
            type: 'image',
            url: 'https://storage.thegivehub.com/evidence/123.jpg',
            timestamp: '2024-03-15T10:30:00Z'
        }],
        verifierSignature: 'GXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'
    }
});
```
