## Platform Overview

Since our launch in 2021, The Give Hub has been connecting remote communities with global donors through our blockchain-enabled platform. Our infrastructure is built on three core principles:

### Transparency
Every transaction is recorded on the Stellar blockchain, providing immutable proof of fund movement and utilization.

### Impact Verification
Our unique impact tracking system ensures donors can see the real-world results of their contributions.

### Global Access
Supporting 32 countries with mobile-first infrastructure and minimal technical requirements.
