# About The Give Hub

## Our Mission

The Give Hub aims to revolutionize charitable giving by leveraging blockchain technology to create transparent, efficient, and impactful donation experiences.

## Core Values

* **Transparency**: All donations are traceable on the blockchain
* **Efficiency**: Low fees and fast transactions
* **Impact**: Focus on measurable outcomes
* **Accessibility**: Making giving easy for everyone

## Our Story

The Give Hub was founded in 2023 by a team of blockchain enthusiasts and non-profit professionals who saw an opportunity to transform charitable giving through technology.

Traditional donation platforms often suffer from high fees, lack of transparency, and slow fund transfers. By leveraging the Stellar blockchain, we've created a solution that addresses these challenges while providing donors and organizations with a seamless experience.

## How It Works

1. **Campaign Creation**: Verified non-profits create fundraising campaigns
2. **Donor Contributions**: Donors contribute using cryptocurrency or traditional currencies
3. **Blockchain Processing**: Donations are processed on the Stellar blockchain
4. **Transparent Tracking**: All transactions are publicly visible and trackable
5. **Impact Reporting**: Organizations report on how funds are used

## Technology

The Give Hub is built on the following technologies:

- **Stellar Blockchain**: For fast, low-cost transactions
- **React.js**: For our user interface
- **Node.js**: For our backend services
- **PostgreSQL**: For our traditional database needs
