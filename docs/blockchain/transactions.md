# Transaction Management

## Overview

Transaction management is a critical component of The Give Hub platform, handling the lifecycle of donation transactions from initiation to settlement on the Stellar blockchain. This documentation explains how transactions are processed, monitored, and managed within the platform.

## Transaction Flow

### 1. Donation Initiation

When a donor makes a donation:

1. The frontend application creates a donation record
2. The payment processing system handles the initial payment (credit card, bank transfer, etc.)
3. A corresponding blockchain transaction is queued

### 2. Blockchain Transaction Creation

Once payment is processed:

1. The transaction service creates a Stellar transaction
2. Transaction parameters (sender, recipient, amount, memo) are set
3. The platform signs the transaction using its signing keys
4. The transaction is submitted to the Stellar network

### 3. Transaction Monitoring

After submission:

1. The transaction is monitored for confirmation
2. The platform waits for consensus (typically 3-5 seconds on Stellar)
3. Transaction status is updated based on blockchain confirmations

### 4. Settlement and Notification

After confirmation:

1. The transaction is marked as settled
2. Receipts are generated for donors
3. Organizations are notified of received funds
4. Impact metrics are updated

## Transaction Types

The Give Hub supports several transaction types:

### Donation Transactions

Standard donations from donors to campaigns:

- Simple payments from donor wallets or platform wallets to campaign wallets
- Include donation references in transaction memos
- Automatically generate tax receipts

### Disbursement Transactions

Transfers from campaign wallets to organization wallets:

- Can be automatic or milestone-based
- May require multi-signature authorization for large amounts
- Include campaign reference in transaction memos

### Fee Transactions

Platform fee collection:

- Automatically calculated based on donation amount
- Transferred to platform treasury wallet
- Transparent fee structure visible to all users

### Refund Transactions

Return of funds to donors:

- Used in case of campaign cancellation or specific refund requests
- Requires administrative approval
- Includes reference to original donation

## Transaction Metadata

Each transaction includes metadata for tracking and reference:

- **Transaction ID**: Unique platform identifier
- **Blockchain Transaction Hash**: Stellar transaction identifier
- **Memo**: Additional reference information
- **Timestamps**: Creation, submission, and confirmation times
- **Status**: Current transaction state
- **Related Entities**: IDs of associated donations, campaigns, etc.

## Status Tracking

Transactions progress through the following statuses:

1. **Created**: Transaction record created in the database
2. **Queued**: Waiting to be processed
3. **Submitted**: Sent to the Stellar network
4. **Pending**: Awaiting confirmation
5. **Confirmed**: Successfully processed on the blockchain
6. **Failed**: Transaction failed (with reason)
7. **Expired**: Transaction expired before confirmation

## Error Handling and Recovery

The platform includes robust error handling:

### Automatic Retry Logic

- Failed transactions are automatically retried based on failure reason
- Exponential backoff for network-related issues
- Maximum retry attempts configurable by transaction type

### Manual Intervention

- Administrative interface for managing problematic transactions
- Ability to force-retry or cancel hanging transactions
- Detailed error logs for debugging

### Recovery Procedures

- Automatic reconciliation for transactions with unclear status
- Periodic balance verification against blockchain state
- Consistency checks between internal records and blockchain

## Transaction Monitoring

The platform provides monitoring tools:

### Real-time Dashboard

- Live transaction feed
- Status breakdowns by transaction type
- Error rate monitoring
- Average confirmation times

### Alerting System

- Notifications for transaction failures
- Alerts for unusual activity
- Monitoring of blockchain network health

## Transaction Scalability

To handle high transaction volumes:

- Queuing system for transaction batching
- Priority handling for different transaction types
- Horizontal scaling of transaction processing nodes
- Load balancing across multiple Stellar nodes

## Transaction Security

Security measures include:

- Multi-signature requirements for high-value transactions
- IP-based anomaly detection
- Rate limiting on transaction creation
- Threshold monitoring for unusual activity

## Transaction Analytics

The platform provides:

- Transaction volume trends
- Average donation size
- Fee collection statistics
- Transaction success rates
- Geographical distribution of transactions

## Blockchain Explorers

Transactions can be verified on public blockchain explorers:

- [Stellar Expert](https://stellar.expert/explorer/public)
- [StellarChain](https://stellarchain.io)
- [Lumenscan](https://lumenscan.io)

To view a transaction, search for the transaction hash on any of these explorers.
