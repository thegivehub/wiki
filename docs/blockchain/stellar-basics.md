# Stellar Blockchain Integration

## Overview

The Give Hub utilizes the Stellar blockchain as its underlying infrastructure for transparent, secure, and efficient donation management. This document outlines the key aspects of our Stellar integration and how it benefits both donors and recipient organizations.

## Why Stellar?

We chose Stellar for The Give Hub platform for several compelling reasons:

- **Low Transaction Costs**: Stellar transaction fees are minimal (0.00001 XLM per transaction), making it ideal for donations of any size.
- **Fast Settlement**: Transactions confirm in 3-5 seconds, providing immediate feedback to donors.
- **Built-in Decentralized Exchange**: Allows for seamless conversion between different currencies and assets.
- **Energy Efficient**: Stellar's consensus protocol is environmentally friendly compared to proof-of-work blockchains.
- **Compliance Features**: Stellar supports compliance needs for non-profit organizations.

## Key Concepts

### Assets

On Stellar, assets can represent many different things:

- **XLM (Lumens)**: The native currency of the Stellar network
- **Fiat tokens**: Digital representations of currencies like USD, EUR, etc.
- **Custom tokens**: Organizations can issue their own tokens

The Give Hub supports donations in XLM and select fiat-backed tokens.

### Accounts

Each user and organization on The Give Hub has a Stellar account, which consists of:

- **Public Key**: The account address (starting with 'G')
- **Secret Key**: The private key used to sign transactions (starting with 'S')

**IMPORTANT**: Never share your secret key with anyone, including The Give Hub team.

### Transactions

Donations on The Give Hub are processed as Stellar transactions, which:

- Are immutable once confirmed
- Can be viewed on any Stellar blockchain explorer
- Include custom memos for tracking purposes

1. Donors initiate donations through our UI
2. Our API creates and submits transactions to the Stellar network
3. Transactions are confirmed and tracked in real-time
4. Recipient organizations receive funds directly to their Stellar accounts

## Getting Started
