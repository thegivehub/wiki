# Jumio Integration Guide for TheGiveHub

This guide explains how to implement and use the Jumio KYC (Know Your Customer) verification system in your TheGiveHub application.

## 1. File Structure Overview

The following files have been created or modified for the Jumio integration:

- **JumioService.php**: Core service for integrating with Jumio API
- **KycController.php**: Controller for handling KYC-related API endpoints
- **jumio-config.php**: Configuration settings for the Jumio integration
- **KycManager.js**: Frontend JavaScript module for managing KYC processes
- **kyc-verification.html**: User-facing verification page
- **kyc-admin.html**: Admin interface for managing verifications
- **api.php**: Updated to include KYC-related routes

## 2. Environment Setup

### 2.1 Environment Variables

Add the following environment variables to your server:

```
JUMIO_API_TOKEN=your_jumio_api_token
JUMIO_API_SECRET=your_jumio_api_secret
JUMIO_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_webhook_secret
JUMIO_STANDARD_WORKFLOW_ID=100
JUMIO_ENHANCED_WORKFLOW_ID=200
```

### 2.2 Database Setup

Create a new collection in MongoDB called `kyc_verifications` to store verification records.

### 2.3 File Placement

- Place PHP files in your `lib/` directory
- Place JavaScript files in your `assets/js/` directory
- Place HTML files in the appropriate frontend directories

## 3. Implementation Steps

1. **Create JumioService.php**: This class handles all interactions with the Jumio API.
2. **Update KycController.php**: Ensure it correctly uses the JumioService class.
3. **Create jumio-config.php**: Contains all configuration settings for Jumio.
4. **Add KycManager.js**: Frontend module for interacting with KYC endpoints.
5. **Create verification pages**: User and admin interfaces for the KYC process.
6. **Update api.php**: Add routes for handling KYC endpoints.

## 4. User Flow

### 4.1 User Verification Process

1. User navigates to the verification page
2. User clicks "Start Verification"
3. System initiates verification with Jumio
4. User is redirected to Jumio platform to complete verification
5. After completing verification, user is redirected back to your site
6. Verification status is updated via webhook

### 4.2 Admin Management

1. Admin navigates to the KYC admin page
2. Admin can view all verification statuses
3. Admin can filter verifications by status, date, etc.
4. Admin can manually override verification statuses when necessary

## 5. API Endpoints

- **POST /api/kyc/initiate**: Start a new verification process
- **POST /api/kyc/webhook**: Receive webhook notifications from Jumio
- **GET /api/kyc/status**: Get verification status for current user
- **POST /api/kyc/admin-override**: Admin override for verification status
- **GET /api/kyc/report**: Generate report of verification data

## 6. Testing the Integration

### 6.1 Sandbox Testing

1. Set up a Jumio sandbox account
2. Use test credentials in your environment variables
3. Test the verification flow with test documents provided by Jumio
4. Test webhook handling by manually sending webhook payloads

### 6.2 Verification States to Test

- Successful verification
- Failed verification (document issues)
- Expired verification
- Cancelled verification
- Error states

## 7. Going to Production

Before going to production:

1. Replace sandbox credentials with production credentials
2. Update URLs in jumio-config.php
3. Implement robust error handling and logging
4. Set up monitoring for webhook failures
5. Implement retry mechanisms for failed API calls

## 8. Security Considerations

### 8.1 Data Protection

- Store all sensitive KYC data securely in your database
- Implement proper access controls for admin functions
- Ensure PII (Personally Identifiable Information) is encrypted at rest
- Set up secure HTTPS for all API endpoints and frontend pages

### 8.2 Webhook Security

- Validate webhook signatures using JUMIO_WEBHOOK_SECRET
- Implement IP whitelisting for Jumio webhook endpoints
- Set up rate limiting to prevent DoS attacks
- Log all webhook events for auditing purposes

### 8.3 API Security

- Use strong API token and secret management
- Rotate credentials periodically
- Implement JWT expiration and refresh properly
- Monitor for suspicious activities in the KYC verification process

## 9. Troubleshooting Common Issues

### 9.1 Webhook Not Received

1. Check webhook URL is correctly configured in Jumio dashboard
2. Verify server can receive external requests (not blocked by firewall)
3. Check for SSL certificate issues
4. Examine server logs for rejected requests

### 9.2 Verification Flow Issues

1. Clear browser cache and cookies if verification window has issues
2. Check console for JavaScript errors
3. Verify user tokens are valid when initiating verification
4. Ensure redirect URLs are properly configured

### 9.3 API Request Failures

1. Verify API credentials are correct
2. Check request payload format matches Jumio requirements
3. Review API response codes and error messages
4. Implement better error handling and user feedback

## 10. Extending the Integration

### 10.1 Additional Features

- Implement document upload for manual verification as a fallback
- Add email notifications for verification state changes
- Create verification reminders for incomplete verifications
- Build detailed analytics dashboards for conversion tracking

### 10.2 Integration with Other Systems

- Connect verification status with user privileges in your app
- Integrate with fraud detection systems
- Add compliance reporting features
- Link with account approval workflows

## 11. Maintenance

### 11.1 Regular Tasks

- Monitor Jumio API version changes and update accordingly
- Track webhook success rates and investigate failures
- Review verification rejection reasons to identify patterns
- Update test cases for new verification flows

### 11.2 Performance Monitoring

- Track verification completion rates
- Monitor API response times
- Set up alerts for verification failures
- Create dashboard for KYC funnel analysis

## 12. Compliance Requirements

- Maintain records of verifications for regulatory purposes
- Implement proper data retention policies
- Ensure privacy notices are updated to reflect KYC processes
- Keep documentation of the verification workflow for audits

By following this implementation guide, you'll have a robust Jumio KYC verification system integrated into your TheGiveHub application that handles the entire verification lifecycle, from initiation to administrative management.
